When I started my career, data was something that happened in spreadsheets. Then, gradually, it started happening everywhere — in databases, in dashboards, in pipelines I had no idea how to debug at 11pm.

Here are five things I wish someone had told me earlier.

## 1. SQL will outlive every trend

I've seen tools come and go. Hadoop had its moment. So did [insert your current favourite data tool here]. But SQL? SQL is still there, quietly running everything. If I could go back and tell my 22-year-old self one thing: learn SQL properly. Not just `SELECT *`, but window functions, CTEs, query optimisation.

It's not glamorous. But it's foundational.

## 2. The question matters more than the answer

Junior analysts spend a lot of energy answering questions. Senior analysts spend a lot of energy figuring out whether they're answering the *right* question.

I've built beautiful dashboards that nobody used because they answered the wrong thing. The best data work starts before you open a notebook.

## 3. Communication is a technical skill

No one told me I'd spend as much time writing emails and presenting findings as writing code. The ability to translate a complex analysis into something a non-technical stakeholder understands — and cares about — is genuinely hard. It took me years to stop underestimating it.

## 4. Domain knowledge is your superpower

The best data analyst I've ever worked with wasn't the best coder. They were the person who understood the *business* better than anyone else in the room. Data without context is just numbers. Domain knowledge is what turns it into insight.

## 5. Burnout is real, and it often hides as productivity

The data world rewards people who go deep, who say yes to every request, who run one more model, build one more report. But sustainability matters. You can't do good analytical work when you're running on empty.

Protect your energy like you protect your data — carefully, intentionally, and with backups.
