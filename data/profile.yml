about: |
  My journey into data started from an unlikely place — a Finance degree and a
  growing obsession with what technology could do with numbers. That pivot shaped
  everything: how I think, how I solve problems, and how I bridge the gap between
  raw data and real business impact.

  I currently work at IKEA's Global Digital Group and lecture at UNIR, combining
  hands-on data work with a passion for teaching. Certified by Microsoft,
  MicroStrategy, and Google — and always chasing the next thing to learn.

  I also believe tech should be for everyone. So whenever I can, I try to open
  that door a little wider.
